The worlds biggest polluters - the U.S.A, the EU, and China along with many other developed countries - have pledged to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 or 2060, but today these countries are far from being on track to actually hit their goals. While many people respond to this reality with despair, apathey, or optimism that technology will save the day, Vaclav Smil offers some much needed realism in this book as he explains the challenges of carbon-neutrality. How the World Really Works teaches us that the modern world is heavily reliant on fossil fuels as inputs to its energy, food, and material production. I will briefly summarize the role that fossil fuels play in energy, food, and material production followed by an account of my own reaction to this sobering wake-up call.

## Energy

Long ago, the largest source of energy human and animal muscle. Today the largest source of energy is fossil fuels. Wind and solar are green source of energy but due to their intermittance can only constitue a minority of the energy grid. In Germany, solar panels produce electricy on average 12% of the time. The other 88% of the time it's cloudy, night time, early morning, or late afternoon. Non-intermitten source of energy are required when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. Nuclear power is a non-intermitten source of clean energy but has large upfront capital costs and poor public opinion.

## Food

Growing staple crops like wheat is much cheaper and requires much less land than ever before in history. Modern grain farms produce around 5x more food per acre of farmland than they did prior to World War 2. This is only possible with extensive use of modern chemical fertilizers. The author estimates that without the use of human-made fertizilers, the planet could only produce enough food for 4 billion people, half of the current global population. Thus, we are now reliant on these fertilizers to feed us. Of the three main types of chemical fertilizers - nitrate, potassium, and phosphates - nitrates have the greatest impact on the global emissions due to their primary production input being natural gas. Although alternative methods of delivering nitrogen to plants are being explored by businesses and scientists, none of these approaches look economically viable in the near future.

## Steel, Plastic, Concrete

These materials are manufactured in massive quantities, creating substantial emissions, for building everything from buildings and cars to kitchen appliances. Recycling these materials lowers the energy requirements compared to producing net new materials but recycling lowers material quality over time and can not satisfy the growing demand for these materials.

## My Reaction

I would like to depict how this book made me feel because I think that my response to these feelings may serve as a guide to other people who feel hopelessness when faced with the enormity of humanity's environmental challenge. What I am about to describe is not a long arduous emotional process. It entailed a couple hours of research and reflection in the days following my completion of this book.

While reading this book, my initial feelings were a mix of worry and guilt. I felt guitly that I was part of the problem rather than solution, and I felt worried that other people would use the magnitude of the carbon-neutral challenge or insufficient progress as an excuse to do nothing. While these feelings were uncomfortable, the good news is that I got to choose how to respond to them.

I responded to my own worries about the apathy of others with some life advice that has nothing to do with environmental sustainability - don't worry about what you can't control, and you can't control other people so worry instead about yourself. I would add to this a couple thoughts that give me hope. The first is that the actions of an individual can inspire people to change their behaviour. When we see others donating time or money to charity, then we are more likely ourselves to mimic these good deeds. The second is that sometimes our brains over generalize. Just because humanity fails to keep global temperatures under the 1.5 degree Celsius target doesn't mean that all hope is lost and it definitely doesn't mean we should give up. Increasing temperatures by only 2 degress is still better than increasing them by 3, 4 or 5 degrees.

While confronting my feelings of being part of the problem rather than the solution, I wondered how difficult it would be to make my year in 2022 carbon-neutral. After all, if we expect our governments to do something about these problems, then we should apply those same standards to ourselves. I started by learning more about which aspects of my life emmitted the most greenhouse gases. It turns out our lifestyle choices play a huge factor in our carbon footprint and per capita emissions vary greatly by continent. I was surprised to learn that the average North American emits twice as much carbon as the average European. I used the carbon footprint calculator located here ([Cool Climate Calculator](https://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/calculator)) and the estimates of planet-friendly lifestyle choices listed here ([Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/)) to get rough estimates of my carbon footprint and what I could do to reduce it. Here's a couple findings that stood out to me about my lifestyle: 1) If I use less hot water for baths, laundry, and dishes, I can reduce my carbon footprint by ~ 1 tonne / year, 2) If I replace meat in my diet with plant alternatives, I can save in the ballpark of 1-2 tonnes / year, 3) Each long haul flight I take (such as crossing North America or going to Europe) emits in the ballpark of 1 tonnes of carbon. Since I made 4 long-haul trips in 2022, my flying emitted ~8 tonnes which is significantly more than any other aspect of my lifestyle. As I looked into purchasing carbon offsets, which are basically a donation to a project that reduces future emissions (such as replacing wood fire cooking with electric stove tops or using filters to sanitize water insteal of boiling water it), I saw the same message repeated by multiple sources - not emitting carbon in the first place is better for the planet than emitting and purchasing carbon offsets but the later is still better than emitting without offsetting at all. I don't plan on being too radical with this new knowledge. I figure that using less hot water, eating less meat, flying once less per year and purchasing carbon offsets for my other flights is a good start. It's at least a better outcome than feeling guilty and not doing anything differently.
