Today, I helped someone, a stranger in fact, move into a new apartment. It was my first time volunteering with Shelter Movers which is a charitable organization that eases the financial, emotional, and physical barriers to fleeing an abusive household.

This experience was rewarding for three different reasons. First, it taught me almost everything I now know about domestic violence. Second, it stretched my identity through doing something new. Third, it opened my eyes to non-traditional ways of serving others.

I found Shelter Movers while searching online for local charities, and I thought it would be fun to help lighten another's load. After a quick phone interview, Shelters Movers asked me to attend a class to learn about domestic-violence and how we can provide trauma-informed care while volunteering. We talked about being aware of social power dynamics and conversation topics that can cause distress to someone living with trauma. In fact, I would like to pause and warn you that the rest of this paragraph talks about the painful and sad realities of domestic violence, so please skip it if you think that would be best for you. Prior to this class, I had no experience and little awareness of just how bad domestic and gender-based violence is in Canada. I was surprised to learn that the most dangerous place for women and children in Canada is in their own home. Some alarming facts that I learned are 83% of people who experience violence are women and 41% of murders of Canadian women are by current or former intimate partners.

I also learned that leaving a violent household is not easy. There are financial barriers, safety concerns, logistical challenges, fear of what others in the community will think. While Shelter Movers only helps with the logistical challenges of leaving abusive households, I think that it means a lot to those we serve. Imagine the stress involved with a typical move: the mountain of work involved, the emotions, the costs. Now imagine the stress of a move in the aftermath of violence and trauma. The pre-move class taught me a lot about domestic violence, but it also set the context for how our seemingly small act of service could provide so much relief to those we help move.

A couple of days prior to my first move, I received a multi-step itinerary for the day of the move which reminded me how complicated moving can be. On the day of the move we drove to a storage unit, then to the truck rental, then the car rental and finally to the first residence where we started filling the moving truck with boxes of children's toys, bags of clothing, and furniture.

During the 4-hour move, I said to myself on several occasions, usually after lifting something heavy, "Why am I doing this?" My mind repeated a phrase from the pre-move class, "we are just friends helping friends move", but that felt like a bit of a stretch because I didn't know anybody that was there. I knew that I would help a friend move, so why did it feel weird to help a stranger move. Perhaps because my mind was asking what's in it for me? As another volunteer played Jenga in the moving truck, I walked back to grab another box of kids toys and thought about a story I had heard from Ram Dass.

In the story, Ram Dass's father asked him why he was charging such little money for the book he had written. Ram Dass then asked his father who was a lawyer, if he had charged his full rate last year when helping a family member with a legal situation. Ram Dass's father said "Of course not, I can't do that to Uncle Tom!" Ram Dass then says "That's the problem! I can't look at any human being and not see the Uncle Tom-ness in that person". I pushed myself to see the single mom that we were helping move as a friend rather than a stranger. Aside from perspective, I think identity played a part here as well. I didn't think that I was the kind of person who would help a stranger move, so it felt weird to stretch my identity while doing exactly that. This shift in perspective and identity was the second rewarding part of the move.

As the day unfolded, I came to appreciate all the different moving parts â€“ the car rental, truck rental, security gauds, and volunteers acting as movers. All of these were donated by volunteers or businesses. When I think of giving to charity, the first types that come to mind are donations of food, clothing, and healthcare, but I learned that day that even Penske truck rental can give to charity in meaningful ways. I realized that there are many more ways to give to others than I originally thought. I wondered what other tasks that seem inconsequential to me could be immensely stressful for others.

Volunteering with Shelter Movers taught me about an important societal issue, challenged me to stretch my identity around helping not only friends but strangers, and gave me a new perspective on how ordinary services like security and truck rental can be life changing for those with challenging life circumstances. I hope that sharing my experience with you prompts you to also think about giving and service in new ways.
