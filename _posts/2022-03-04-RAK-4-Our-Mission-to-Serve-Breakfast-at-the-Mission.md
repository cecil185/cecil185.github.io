As Easter weekend draws to a close, I am grateful for many things; particularly the extra day off work to recharge and the opportunity to visit with family this weekend. I am extra aware of these gifts in my life after having spent Good Friday serving breakfast to those in need of a hot meal. It was that first time that I volunteered with such a program. I left feeling good about serving others as well as connected to the community that we served. Today's heightened sense of gratitude is the result of several days of one comment from that morning rattling around my head.

First, a bit about the organization with which we served, the Brunswick Street Mission, the community, and how we got enrolled. Since 1860, the purpose of the Brunswick Street Mission has been to inspire a better quality of life for those experiencing poverty. If you scroll back to RAK #2, you'll remember that mine and Mariah's involvement with the Mission began with our food donation. While delivering our food donation, a man named Matt received it and offered to give us a tour of the building. On our tour through the facility, Matt showed us the many services that the Mission provides: a food bank, laundry machines, a temporary shelter, help with annual taxes, a hot breakfast program, and a safe injection site to name a few. I asked Matt if they needed volunteers for any of these services (aside from the tax clinic since my accounting skills are less than subpar), and he suggested the breakfast program. Intrigued by the opportunity to interact with others and to brighten the start of someone else's day, we decided to try it.

Fast forward a couple weeks, Mariah and I arrived bright and early on Good Friday to help make and serve breakfast. Making breakfast sounds simple, but considering the community's significant need for a hot breakfast (especially in COVID times when other programs have had to stop in-person services), the task of serving breakfast to over 60 people was a challenge. Right away we got cracking on cracking 100 eggs, buttering a mountain of toast, plating meals, offering juice, and preparing for the next surge of people. Thankfully, we worked alongside other friendly volunteers who showed us the ropes and provided fun and pleasant conversation as we worked. Admittedly, I wasn't thinking much during the process. My mind was present while my hands were busy buttering toast or washing dishes. This presence made the 3 hours that we were there fly by.

Returning to the comment that stuck with me the most that morning, our chef remarked that with it being Good Friday, some other programs offering a hot breakfast were closed on this holiday. To him, this didn't make any sense because for those we serve, there are no days off from poverty. These folks rely on the Brunswick Street Mission for breakfast not only on Good Friday, but every other Friday too. As I thought about what he said, I noticed that many of the people we served seemed to come there alone. I wondered if they had families. I wondered if they cared that it was Easter. Was this weekend the same, or maybe even worse, than all the others? On the drive home from the program, traffic was light, and at home, our building's parking garage had many empty parking spots left by those who vacated the city for Easter weekend. The next day, even Mariah and I left the city to have Easter dinner with a large group of loving family members

I suspect that in my future comings to the Brunswick Street Mission breakfast program, I still won't be thinking about much as I help serve food. I'll be enjoying the passing moments cracking eggs and engaging with the other volunteers and community members. At the moment, I am reminding myself that not everyone enjoyed the extra day off work or the opportunity to spend time with family members this weekend. As a result, I'm more keenly aware of these gifts in my life.

Thank you to Mariah for the editorial support on this article.
