Volunteering with the Brunswick Street Mission breakfast program has become a welcome addition to my Friday routine. When I leave the breakfast program and arrive at work, I feel like I have already accomplished something significant. I guess it is a pretty significant difference to cook breakfast for 60 people rather than just for myself.

Other than our substitution of breakfast sausages with fried bologna one week, for which we received mixed reviews from our diners, the work involved has been mostly the same. My original prediction, that I would be lost in the process rather than thinking any particular thoughts while we cook breakfast, has been mostly true.

I am particularly grateful that our leader in the kitchen, chef Darren, has such nice things to say about the people that we serve. Darren has known the community quite well since way before he started cooking with the breakfast program.

Last week was quieter than normal. Darren predicted this was due to the timing being the end of the month which is when income assistance cheques arrive. Darren suggested that this indicated the desire of those we serve to not be greedy and to use their own means of getting food when they had them. I am glad that Darren said this. Had he not said it, I would have assumed that the low attendance was caused by increased substance abuse after receiving income assistance cheques which I realized was a very judgemental assumption to make about people I don't know.

Negatively judging people isn't reflective of the type of person that I want to be. As we served breakfast the remainder of the morning, I tried to be more aware of harsh and judgemental thoughts. I started to smile at all the little things that used to bother me such as diners not putting their dishes away, asking for multiple breakfasts (which isn't allowed), or not saying thank you. It's hard to quiet the judgemental part of the mind, but slowly I started to meet these judgements and feelings of resentment with gentleness and compassion.

I discovered a technique that created more compassion within me which was to imagine myself acting in the same way that I was observing others act. This was easy because I can think of many times where I should have but did not say thank you or clean my own dishes (thanks mom). It's also important to note that most of the people that we serve are extremely kind, gracious, and friendly. I reminded myself that any group of people will have people with varying degrees of agreeableness.

In my life outside of Friday mornings, I started to feel more compassion for the people dealing with poverty in my own neighbourhood. I joked with Mariah that this week's random act of kindness has been the only truly random act of kindness because it happened without any prior thought while previous acts were premeditated.

Most days I walk to the grocery store or my gym via Spring Garden Road which typically has people on it asking for spare change. On my way home from the grocery store I encountered a woman asking for spare change. I said to her "I don't have any change, but I do have some honey crisp apples in this grocery bag, would you like one". She accepted, so I reached in the bag pulled out an apple and gave it to her. We smiled at each other and I continued walking home. What a small act. In fact for some people it would be too small to even remember or talk about, but I rarely ever give spare change or food to people on the street. In fact, I am now thinking about how much I used to resent walking by people asking for money.

A couple of summers ago, I had a summer job at an office on Spring Garden. I walked to work every day by the same three people asking for spare change. My answer was always no, and I think that I would have grown to resent their relentless requests for spare change if not for the total sweetness of one woman. You could sense her gentleness as you walked by her. This woman smiled at every person that passed her, looked them in the eyes and wished them a nice day regardless of if they had anything for her. I actually looked forward to walking by this woman and having the opportunity to smile and wish her a nice day as well. Another example of a gentle soul helping me break free from judgement and resentment.

I know that sharing an apple isn't much, but I do think that spending more time at the breakfast program is making me less judgemental of people dealing with poverty. I am grateful that Darren models gentleness and compassion at the breakfast program. It reminds me not to paint entire groups of people with one brush and not to judge people based on minimal interactions.
