On weekend mornings I like to go for walks after breakfast during which I listen to podcasts. Last weekend, I listened to Jay Shetty talk about 8 types of people that, when present in our lives, improve our health and happiness. Afterwards, I decided to write 7 letters of gratitude and admiration, one per day for the next week, to those people in my life. I invite you to explore the benefits of this simple practice with me.

One particular benefit that surprised me the most was increased appreciation for the positive qualities of other people, not just the people to whom I wrote letters but even complete strangers.

I estimate having spent over 3 hours writing these letters; however, these were not long letters. In fact, they were only 4" x 3" cards, so why did it take me so long to write these little notes? The time-consuming part was thinking about my friends' positive qualities (not because they don't have any; they have plenty). I wanted the compliments to sound genuine and personalized. Throughout the process, it became easier to find and articulate my subject's positive qualities. It was like I was training my mind to see the good in others, and I experienced the ease and benefit of this mental pattern in my daily life. I noticed that a woman in my meditation group smiling and looking at each person in the room equally, not giving any extra attention to a specific person. I admired the clerk at the grocery store scanning and placing each item with precision and care. Ultimately, what's in it for all of us in training our admiration mental muscle is the gift of healthier emotions: gratitude, appreciation, and joy.

This phenomenon works the opposite way as well. After picking up garbage in the cemetery during RAK #1, I couldn't help but notice how much garbage was scattered throughout my city. I had to make a conscious effort to ignore the garbage that I walked by, or I would always be picking up garbage. The mind finds what it looks for.

I encourage you to spend some time each day admiring the good in others, yourself, or your life. Push yourself while you do it. If I wrote the same letter everyone, telling them how kind and funny they are, then I wouldn't have exercised the admiration mental muscle enough. Over time it gets easier, and you will notice the difference in your daily emotions.
