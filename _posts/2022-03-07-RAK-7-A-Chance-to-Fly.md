Two months ago I challenged myself to give seven random acts of kindness to others. Why seven? I wanted to try a variety of kind acts on a regular basis. There were eight weeks until I left Halifax for a trip to Europe, so I would do one RAK per week with one extra week of buffer. I had no idea what the RAKs would be. Each RAK was unique. Some RAKs were pre-meditated, others were truly random, most of them involved non-monetary gifts and many were completed with the help of my partner, Mariah. The final RAK occurred literally as I was getting on a plane to Europe, the trip that I had set as my deadline for these seven RAKs. I gifted someone the ability to get on the plane.

The boarding process was being rushed by the air line staff since the plane had already been delayed. As I presented my boarding pass at the kiosk, the air line crew member said that I specifically needed a KN95 mask to fly to Italy. The standard blue medical mask that I was wearing was insufficient. She said to go up stairs to buy one from a vending machine. Along with a handful of other passengers who were in the same boat as me, I walked up stairs. Knowing that the plane boarding was in progress and time was tight, I started to run. About 200 meters down the hall, I arrived at a vending machine which had blue medical masks and latex gloves but no KN95 masks. The passengers, including myself, looking for KN95 masks were obviously starting to worry that we would miss the flight. Frantically, I started asking airport staff where to get a KN95 mask.

Another passenger from my flight appeared to have received one from a passenger on a different flight. I asked anyone available for a KN 95 mask but no one could help me. The airport security guard's response to my plea was that I would have to leave the departures area to buy a mask, then return through security again. Meanwhile, the plane was still boarding! I thought there's no way I'm going to make this flight but decided to try anyway. As I passed the baggage claim belts, I asked a handful of airport staff and recently arrived passengers waiting to pick up their bags where to get a KN95 masks. Nobody knew. Now through the one-way door leaving the airport, I saw a man wearing a KN95 mask. I rushed up to him and blurted out "Sir please give me your mask, I'm going to miss my flight!" He looked at me puzzled, then said "I can just give you a new one."

"I need 2 masks! Do you have have two?" I needed a second mask for my mom to board the flight.

Then I remembered the many other people who also couldn't board the plane due to having the wrong mask.

"Actually, give me as many masks as you can!"

In what can only be an act of divine will, the man pulled out a box of many masks and gave me 3 masks.

I sprinted to security screening praying that the line would be small. Luckily, there was only 1 person in line. They were also from my flight.

Now through security, I was running back to the gate and thinking who would I give the third mask to. I thought that a discrete pass to someone in need would best prevent me from being mobbed by the 10 or so people without the proper mask. As I neared the gate, a woman asked me where I got my KN95. Without stopping to say anything I put my extra mask in her hand. The three of us, myself, my mom, and this woman, made the flight. I'm not sure how many passengers didn't make the flight.

In the plane, I felt guilty for having not begged the man with the box of masks to give me every mask he had. Then I thought that I could just have easily asked only for the 2 masks that my mom and I needed. It's easy to think more about oneself than others in times of scarcity. I thought of the psychology experiment where religion students who were walking to deliver a sermon on The Good Samaritan (wait for the irony) were much less likely to help a stranger visibly in need of help when the student was late for their talk. They were too busy thinking about themselves.

I contemplated throughout the flight if thinking of other passengers during my frantic search for KN95 masks constituted a random act of kindness. To me, these small acts of kindness or courtesy to others do count. Including them encourages me to look for ways to help others as a daily habit rather than only thinking of others during scheduled volunteering. I accept that people's definitions of RAKs will vary. At my summer camp, where I first learned of 'RAKs', pre-meditated gestures didn't count (the reasoning behind this was to prevent young kids from seeking the RAK award for attention). I decided to change that rule for my personal 7-RAK challenge. Similarly, I decided that donating money as a RAK was okay every now and again but shouldn't be over-used. Only 1 of my 7 RAKs involved a monetary donation (in RAK #2 we spent money on food that we donated).

So what's next? My original goal with the 7-RAK challenge was to try a variety of kind acts. Having accomplished this goal, I'll be changing my approach from sporadic sampling of charitable acts and regimented writing to regimented volunteering with the Brunswick Street Mission breakfast program and sporadic writing. Of course, I'll also continue strengthening the habit of looking for opportunities to help others because small gestures on a frequent basis add up.
