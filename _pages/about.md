## Hey! I'm Cecil Ash

I'm a data engineer based in Florida, USA with a passion for using data to solve meaningful problems and a commitment to giving back to my community.

### My Blog

My blog captures three main areas of my life and interests:

**🤝 Random Acts of Kindness (RAK)**  
In 2022, I challenged myself to perform seven random acts of kindness over seven weeks. This series documents everything from cleaning up Fort Massey Cemetery to volunteering with the Brunswick Street Mission. These experiences taught me about community, compassion, and the profound impact of small gestures.

**📊 Data & Analytics**  
As an analytics engineer, I work with dbt and other modern data tools to help businesses make better decisions. I write about the parallels I see between data work and other areas of life, like watercolor painting, and share insights about building truly actionable dashboards.

**📚 Book Reflections**  
I read voraciously and reflect on how books shape my understanding of the world. From climate science to personal development, I explore how the ideas I encounter in books translate into real-world action and perspective.
