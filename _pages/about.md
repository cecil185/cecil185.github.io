## Hey! I'm Cecil Ash

I'm a data engineer based in Florida, USA with a passion for using data to solve meaningful problems, giving back to my community, and continuous learning.

### My Blog

My blog captures three main areas of my life and interests:

**🤝 Random Acts of Kindness (RAK)**  
I challenged myself to perform seven random acts of kindness over seven weeks. This series documents everything from cleaning up my local cemetery to giving an apple to a stranger.

**📊 Data & Analytics**  
I write about the parallels I see between data work and other areas of life, like watercolor painting, and share insights about building truly actionable dashboards.

**📚 Book Reflections**  
I explore how the ideas I encounter in books translate into real-world action and perspective.
