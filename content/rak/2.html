<h2>RAK #2: Buying Local and Gifting Local</h2>

<p>
People don’t buy things, they buy stories. What do your buying habits say about you and your values? This Saturday my partner and I discussed donating food to Feed Nova Scotia, a local charity fighting food insecurity in the province. I was surprised to find out that they accept perishable food. My partner, Mariah, proposed that we not only donate fresh fruit and vegetables, which we thought would be healthier and in higher demand than non-perishable foods, but also that we buy them from the local farmer’s market. At first, I felt resistant to the idea of buying food from the farmer’s market, but Mariah eventually convinced me. While performing this small act of kindness I reflected on the different meaning and values that Mariah and I each assigned to the act resulting in her excitement and my resistance.

Mariah loves farmers markets. She frequently walks to the Halifax seaport farmers market on Saturday mornings, and she was saddened when they moved its previous location to a smaller adjacent building. She even talks about visiting the best other farmers markets in the province. Mariah and I discussed her affinity with farmers markets and uncovered multiple positive associations. To Mariah, who grew up in a small farming community, these markets symbolize community. She recounted childhood memories about going to her local farmers market and running into people you know from the community. The Halifax farmers market has many more unfamiliar faces but the relative consistency in vendors provides some level of familiarity. Mariah initially described the emotions she experiences at farmer’s markets as “it’s just a good feeling”. We later uncovered that admiration for the work that farmers do contributes to this good feeling. She also feels a sense of familiarity with the farming lifestyle. Mariah’s family has run a potato farm for generations. She grew up admiring her family’s dedication to putting good quality potatoes on her dinner plate and the plates of others in the community. The family works hard to grow potatoes and is proud of their product.

When she buys produce from the farmers market, she feels connected to the food and the farmer’s life because she appreciates how much hard work and love goes into farming. In contrast, when Mariah buys produce at large grocery stores with the words “Made in California” or “Made in Mexico”, no emotions at all are stirred.

I discovered during this process that my initial hesitation to buy our food donation from the local farmer’s market was caused by the thought that we could probably buy cheaper produce elsewhere. Buying from local farmers didn’t muster strong feelings inside me. Like many others, I have not spent much time on a farm and I like buying cheap things. But listening to Mariah’s values, stories, and feelings on local growers changed the meaning I attribute to buying local produce.

<p>
Why do I think it is important to examine the meaning you attribute to actions? Many of our values and beliefs were subconsciously infused by those around us rather than chosen by us. Upon examination you may find that your current values do not support the life you envision. If this rings true, you can replace old values with new ones but don’t just think your way to new values. You’ll need stories and emotions to influence your behaviour.
