<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>
I work at a software company and my job is to build data reports for our customers. My team’s mission is to provide insights that help accounting firm owners improve their business’ profitability, productivity, or quality of service. Some of our dashboards accomplish this mission, while others, particularly our earlier releases, did not help firm owners improve their business. For months, I have been reflecting on what elements make a dashboard effective and thinking of parallels in my personal life. The two dashboards that I look at most frequently in my personal life are my personal health and fitness reports generated by my Oura ring and Whoop. These two devices track the same health metrics, but the Whoop app has much greater impactful on my personal health and fitness. In this essay, I compare how these two devices visualize data in-app and identify what the Whoop app does so well. From this comparison, I distill three take aways for creating impactful data tools.
</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>
For the past year, I have used both the Oura Ring 2.0 and Whoop 4.0 to track heart rate, heart rate variability, and skin temperature. This data is used to measure the overall stress on your body. Their algorithms are quite complex, especially when it comes to identifying different stages of sleep (light, deep, REM), but in general, if your heart rate is low, heart rate variability is high, and skin temperature is high, then your body is resting and repairing. If these metrics move in the opposite direction then your body is being emotionally or physically stressed. These products are supposed to help you make healthier lifestyle choices by providing feedback on how balanced your body is between stress and recovery.
</p>

<h5>Oura Ring</h5>

<p>
I decided not to make any lifestyle changes during the first month that I used my Oura ring. This would accumulate a solid baseline of data against which I could compare the effects of future lifestyle changes. At the end of the first month, I looked through the app to see where I might improve my health. This is when I noticed three main problems with how Oura data reports.
</p>
<p>
The first problem was the sheer volume of data displayed in the reports. There are three reports, sleep, activity, and readiness, each containing 6-10 metrics. That’s around 20 metrics in total which I found to be overwhelming. It reminded me of a story my friend told me wherein they consulted with a business looking to improve all 30 of their key performance indicators (KPIs). Project resources were spread too thinly across too many areas and made little progress in any of them. A business with 30 KPIs effectively has 0 KPIs. In my Oura app, I didn’t know where to start making improvements because I was looking at too many data points.
</p>
<p>
My second problem with the Oura app was that it was not obvious how some metrics were defined. Recovery Index, Latency, and HRV balance, for example, are not commonly understood concepts which means I had to expend effort to learn about them. I looked up the definitions of these terms but due to their complicated nature and the large quantity of metrics, I had forgotten their definitions within weeks.
</p>
<p>
After teaching myself what the technical jargon in the report represented, I was faced with a third issue – I didn’t know how to improve these metrics. Oura provides no suggestions for improving individual metrics like REM sleep or Latency. They provide general feedback like prioritize sleep tonight or take it easy on the activities today, but it isn’t obvious how my less than optimal levels of Deep sleep may or may not have influenced these recommendations.
</p>
<p>
I completed my review of the first month’s data feeling slightly confused but still hopeful that I would improve these metrics and my health if I just made the right improvements, I made several lifestyle changes during the second month that I had an Oura ring. I started meditating before bed and sleeping in when needed due to my newly variable work schedule. I was certain that these would improve my sleep quality. At the end of the second month, I was surprised to see that my average sleep score had stayed roughly the same. I looked again through my data for answers but found none.

<h5>Whoop</h5>

<p>
When I first started using my Whoop, I noticed that it shared some similarities with the Oura ring. Both products share the same three reports. Sleep, activity, and restfulness in Oura are called sleep, strain, and recovery in Whoop but the concepts are identical. Both products also track the same types of data. Despite their similarities, Whoop has two main advantages over Oura: 1) simpler reporting and 2) more actionable recommendations.
</p>
<p>
Lets compare the recovery/restfulness reports from each app side by side. Notice that both apps give you a score between 1 and 100 but Whoop also has red, yellow, and green categories. This color coding is so simple, yet so important, because I know how to act on my recovery score. Whoop has specific guidance for each category.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Green means your body can push it’s limits in physical activity.</li>
    <li>Yellow means you can still engage in light to moderate physical activity but don’t push your limits because you’re still not fully recovered from your previous activity.</li>
    <li>Red means your body needs to recover so you should engage in only light activities like walking.</li>
</ul>  

In Oura, if my restfulness score drops from an 80 to a 70, I don’t know if I should be alarmed. Oura might tell me to take it easy but I otherwise feel fine, so I start giving less credence to Oura recommendations.
</p>

<p>
Whoop also reports accumulated strain on the body throughout the day. After using it for a while I started to think in terms of my strain score. For example, if the Whoop app tells me that a strain score of 14 out of 21 is todays optimal balance between new strain and recovering from past strain, and I know that a strain score of 14 is typically generated by a 7 km run or by doing my typical weight-lifting routine with a couple less heavy sets than normal, then I know exactly what actions to take that day.
</p>
<p>
Whoop’s sleep report is also wonderfully simple and action-oriented. There’s only two concepts in the whole report – how much sleep you need and how much sleep you are getting. When Oura suggests that I “prioritize sleep tonight”, I don’t know what the looks like. How much extra sleep do I need? Whoop, on the other hand, tells me exactly how many hours of sleep I need that night and when to go to bed to get up by my pre-defined wake-up time.

<h5>Take Aways</h5>

<p>
My main take away from using Oura and Whoop devices is that if end users do not use the data you prepared to take actions which improve their lives then you have not done a good enough job. It is a mistake to believe that presenting information alone is a job well done. Disseminating information is just part of being a data practitioner. Doing so in a format that triggers impactful behaviours is essential to creating value from data.
</p>
<p>
In this essay, I proposed two key areas where the Whoop app outperforms the Oura app. First, the Whoop reports are simple. They only display the 3-4 metrics that users need to determine the best course of action. Technical jargon and complex calculations, although available to those users that need them (Whoop makes these available on its website), are not shown by default.
</p>
<p>
The second area in which Whoop outperforms Oura is providing detailed and actionable recommendations. Rather than displaying metrics as a number between 1 and 100, Whoop has red, yellow, and green categories with clear guidance on appropriate physical exertion. In it’s sleep report, Whoop tells you exactly what time to go to bed.
</p>
<p>
If asked during my first month of using Oura what I thought of the product, I would have replied how interesting it was to see all my data, but eventually I stopped checking every day because I didn’t know what actions to take with the information they presented. I needed a simpler report with more detailed recommendations.
</p>
<p>
If end users look at your report and it’s not clear what action they must take, then your report is at worst confusing and at best interesting. And even interesting isn’t good enough.
</p>
<p>
Note – I have no personal connection to either Whoop or Oura that would bias this post.
